# Customer-Revenue-Prediction-App

Customers are the backbone of any modern business. They can lead your business to the greater height if you know how to leverage their participatin.
Customers invest in your services and products at carious stages of their journey which then are call Customer Revenue.
These revenue can be in the form of one-time sales or the recurring revenue.
In this proect, I am trying to find if a customer will generate revinue or not for our company.  

## This project is divided into 3 parts 
1. Building a deep learning model to predict customer purchase completion
2. Build a web app on Django to mount the prediction model.
3. Deploy the Django project on heroky through github. 

## The Deep Learning model: 
I have created a deep learning model or a sequential model with 3 hidden layers and train that model using the customer meta data - datapoints.

## Dango Web App:
This the is second part of the project where we build the web application usnig the framework Dango.
We mount the model we build in the previous part on the django project.

## Deploying on Heroku:
The last part of the projec is we will deploy the Django application on heroku using the connection to github.
